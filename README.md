# CNNVisualizer

This project is based on the paper by Zeiler, Matthew D. and Rob Fergus. “Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks.” ECCV (2014). Link is https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.2901.pdf

Datasets to be used are the ImageNet dataset, the Caltech-101 dataset and the Caltech-256 dataset.

NOTE: Design using separate modular .py scripts, call all of them in 1 final notebook or main file.
